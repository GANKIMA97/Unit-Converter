# Unit-Converter
In this project, I built a simple and practical unit converter that converts miles to kilometers. This tool demonstrates how to use JavaScript to add interactivity to a website, making it easy for users to quickly convert distances. Through this project, I explored the fundamentals of DOM manipulation and user input handling in JavaScript.
